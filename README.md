# NoVRol

This repository contains the Norwegian verb role lexicon described in Henrik Torgersen, Erlend Øyvindssøn Ravnanger, Lars Hellan and Dag Haug, "NoVRol: A semantic role lexicon of Norwegian verbs", DMR workshop 2024.

The data are in a csv file with the following columns: lemma, Norval_frame, UD_frame, example, theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4. The lemma and the Norval frames are taken from the Norval valency lexicon described in Lars Hellan, "A Valence Catalogue for Norwegian", in R. Loukanova (ed) _Natural Language Processing in Artificial Intelligence_, Springer 2021 pp. 49--104. NorVal can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/Regdili-NTNU/NorSource/tree/master/NorVal_files).
